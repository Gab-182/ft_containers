1- Operator* in reverse iterator, it should return *(--tmp)
    I edit it to return *(tmp), Cause *(--tmp) will give me
    the element before the last one.

2- Check the const iterator in vector, and the
    implementation in begin() && end().

3- end() function in the vector need more revision:
    if the function end() return a pointer to the element after the last element in the vector,
    then, isn't that considered as out of range error, or some kind of a security bug?

    [answer] --> It is used in various algorithms and idioms such as range-based for loops,
                    STL algorithms, and more. The iterator returned by end() is
                    used as a stopping condition for looping through the elements of the container.
                    NOTE:|
                    =====|
                    It's important to note that it's undefined behavior to dereference or
                    access the element that the end() function points to,
                    as there is no element at that location.

### BUT IT STILL GIVE MEMORY LEAKS...!!!???
