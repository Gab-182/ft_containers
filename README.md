# ft_containers

#### The designer of STL chose a wonderful yet simple common approach - "The separation of data and operation".
- The data is held and managed by the Container classes.
- The operations over the containers are defined and managed by the configurable algorithms.



In this project I'm re-implementation some of the standard C++ containers with the specific usage.

#### re-implementation of:
```
- std::vector<T>
- std::map<T>
- std::stack<T>
```
